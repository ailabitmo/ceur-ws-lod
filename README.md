# CEUR-WS-LOD

It's an effort to convert existing data from [CEUR-WS.org](http://ceur-ws.org/) to Linked Data dataset. The work is done in the framework of [Semantic Publishing Challenge 2015](https://github.com/ceurws/lod/wiki/SemPub2015) co-located with [ESWC 2015](http://2015.eswc-conferences.org/) conference.

## Semantic Publishing Challenge 2015's Tasks

### Task 1

The goal is to extract information from a set of HTML tables of contents published in the CEUR-WS.org workshop proceedings. The extracted information is expected to answer queries about the quality of these workshops, for instance by measuring growth, longevity, etc.

The source code is available in [ceur-ws-crawler]( https://github.com/ailabitmo/ceur-ws-lod/tree/master/ceur-ws-crawler) folder.

### Task 2

The goal is to extract information from the textual content of the papers (in PDF). That information should provide a deeper understanding of the context in which it was written. In particular, the extracted information is expected to answer queries about authorsâ€™ affiliations and research institutions, research grants and funding bodies, and related works (papers presented in the same venue, addressing similar issues, etc.).

The source code is available in [ceur-ws-pdfs](https://github.com/ailabitmo/ceur-ws-lod/tree/master/ceur-ws-pdfs) folder.
